    # Renders an ItemContainer as a <div> element and its containing items as <a> elements.
    # It adds the 'selected' class to the <a> element that is currently active.
    #
    # The Links renderer cannot be used to render nested navigations. If you would like it to use with nested navigations, you have to render each level separately.
    #
    # By default, the renderer sets the item's key as dom_id for the rendered <a> element unless the config option <tt>autogenerate_item_ids</tt> is set to false.
    # The id can also be explicitely specified by setting the id in the html-options of the 'item' method in the config/navigation.rb file.
    # The ItemContainer's dom_class and dom_id are applied to the surrounding <div> element.
